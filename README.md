# AppWeather

Hey! So, here's what you need to know: This repository contains the source of a React Native based Weather Application (Android only.. for now).

It has a single way to use: just type any brazilian city name and the app will receive the respective weather data through OpenWeather API and show it to you.

Well, I guess you already noticed that you'll need React Native, so, you can learn more about it on http://facebook.github.io/react-native.

Additionally, if you wish, here's everything about OpenWeather API: https://openweathermap.org/api.

If you rather, you can also download the source files here: https://goo.gl/DN6k4o
